# The project

This is a side project that let you create a project. (Like Google Docs... but not really)

The main feature is implementing a FixMe feature that allows you to add placeholders that will be completed later.

## Usage

It was bootstraped with Create React App... So if you are here, I think you should know how it works. But in case...

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

And you're good to go

## Packaged used

I implemented the rich text editor using the wonderful SlateJS project.

## The story

This project is an attempt to make something not useless, and play with React Hooks and rich text editors.
Before SlateJS I tried Jodit and Quill rich text editors, but it was not so concluent with the feature I wanted to implement.

Go try it ! :) It's "fun"

And if you find it useless (you might) the codebase may be an example for someone else's project.
